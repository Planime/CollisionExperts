		title: 'Can I get paid for the damage to my car?',
		description:
			'In most cases, yes. If the at-fault driver’s insurance (or your own policy, depending on coverage) accepts liability, you’re entitled to payment for the damage to your vehicle. That payment can often be issued directly to you or to the repair shop, depending on how you choose to handle repairs and what your policy allows.'

	{
		title: 'How long does the repair process take?',
		description:
			'Repair times vary depending on the severity of the damage, parts availability, and insurance approval. In some cases, repairs can be completed in as little as 3 days, while more complex jobs may take several weeks or even longer. Once we inspect the vehicle, we’ll provide a more accurate timeline based on the specific work required.'
